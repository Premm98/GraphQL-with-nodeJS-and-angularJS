# GraphQL-with-nodeJS-and-angularJS
Implementation of GraphQL and nodeJS for server, AngularJS and apollo for front end  (UI) and mongodb as the date base.
You are required to install mongoDB on your system.
GraphQL pre-installed and postgresql also pre-installed.

Need to have prior knowledge of nodeJS as you will be using node commands in this project.

The UI is not decorated(css is not applied, please adjust.)

You can use your css in index.css according to your convinience.

Thanks..
